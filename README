This is an implementation of the AKS primality test (
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKS_algorithm ) in Go.

To build:

go build *.go

To reproduce the error:

for i in $(seq 1 300); do (env GOGCTRACE=1 ./aks_debug &); done

Then when everything settles down, look at 'ps' and see if there are
any remaining aks_debug processes left.

Removing the profiling code makes the problem go away. So does calling
doWork directly.
