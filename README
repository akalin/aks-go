This is an implementation of the AKS primality test (
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKS_algorithm ) in Go.

To run:

cd bin-src/aks
go build

# Should indicate composite.
./aks 2993374621

# Should indicate prime.
./aks 2685241991

To use in your code:

import "github.com/akalin/aks-go/aks"

var n big.Int
// Set n to the number you wish to test.
var jobs int
// Set jobs to the number of goroutines to use when testing n.
r := aks.CalculateAKSModulus(&n)
M := aks.CalculateAKSUpperBound(&n, r)
a := aks.GetAKSWitness(&n, r, M, *jobs, log.New(os.Stderr, "", 0))
if a != nil {
	// n is composite with AKS witness a
} else {
	// n is prime
}
